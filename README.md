# COS 426 Final Project: 3D Snake

This is a simple version of the classic Snake game - except 3D and from the first-person point of view of the Snake! By Rachel Inman '20 and Archana Sharma '21.

[Online Demo](https://reillybova.github.io/three-seed/)

## Installation
Install [NodeJS and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
Run `npm install`.

## Launching a Local Webserver
To launch locally, run `npm start`.

(## Building the Project for the Web
Once you are happy with your project, try building a production bundle using `npm run build`. This will place an optimized and minified executable version of your project in the `./build/` directory. Test out this production build by setting `./build/` as your working directory and starting out a python server.

Once you have a working production build and are ready for the site to go live, you can deploy your project straight to GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy`. Note that this requires that (1) your project is part of a repository, and (2) you have correctly set up your project's `package.json` file.)
